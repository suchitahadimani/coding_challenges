I discovered John Crickett's Coding Challenges almost a year ago.

Even back then, I could tell the projects proposed here, appealed to more than other projects I had done, primarily due to my interest in understanding systems fundamentally and doing network programming. I had good intentions to start back then, but alas, here were are. Better late than never.

The quality of the projects varies. Starting off, I didn't unit test very much, as the primary focus was on building and getting comfortable and coding often. The goal reamins the same throughout, to be better than I was before. 

The order in which I completed these:
- dns_resolver
- realtime_chat
- rate_limiter
- traceroute
- load_balancer
- ntp
- memcached
