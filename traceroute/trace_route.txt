things i know:
- i want to do this in rust and try out network programming in a different language. this one is just sending out packets on udp, and then measuring for the ICMP time packet and determine the host which sent that packet.
- you want to keep increasing the ttl until it reaches the destinations.

Things i learned:
- one port for sending packets + one port for receiving the ICMP response
- ICMP message stands for Internet Control Message Protocol, mainly used for errors/diagnostics
- Time Exceeded (Type 11) – Used in traceroute to track the path of packets. Code 0: TTL (Time-To-Live) expired in transit

Random but might use in the future projects:
- Echo Request & Echo Reply (Type 8 & 0) – Used by the ping command to check if a host is reachable.
- Timestamp Request & Reply (Type 13 & 14) – Used to synchronize clocks between systems.   -- might use in the ntp implementation?


traceroute was relatively easy to implement in the matter of 30-60 minutes, but of course lots of interesting concepts at play.
it was interesting using ttl and using the built in function to resolve the hostname into an ip address especially since i already implemented that from hand last time.

i also learned about building a python executable and how to create custom commands "ctraceroute" in my case
